gwk/pdfminer3 is a fork of pdfminer/pdfminer.six, which is in turn derived from euske/pdfminer.

pdfminer3 is a tool for extracting information from PDF documents.
Unlike other PDF-related tools, it focuses entirely on getting and analyzing text data.
pdfminer3 obtains the exact location of texts in a page, as well as other information such as fonts or lines.
It includes a PDF converter that can transform PDF files into other text formats (such as HTML).
It has an extensible PDF parser that can be used for other purposes instead of text analysis.
